<center> I have been running since elementary school for fun, but only recently turned competitive in high school. This picture is from me and my ladies at  CIF in cross country this past season where we were one place away form qualifying to state as a team..<bold> ----Fun Fact-----</bold> I got a knee disease last year due to running and I could barley walk without looking like a penguin for three months.  </center>
